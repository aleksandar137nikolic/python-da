Python for Data Analysis examples

Source: https://wesmckinney.com/book/

Focus on:
- manipulating
- processing
- cleaning
- crunching

Learning Goals:
- develop familiarity with common commands

Basic preparation for using python to deal with data, and a stepping stone to more advanced procedures. 
Python is a great language for building data applications. 
Interpeted vs compiled language. Python=int, C++=compilied. Interpreted is slower, but easier to code with.
Class = type



Packages for data analysis:
- NumPy
- pandas* -> cleaning, manipulating, preparation
-- has a lot of time series components, as it was initially built for business and finance needs. so time series is crucial for an economist. Everything in an economy has a time component.
-- pandas -> panel data frame, econometrics
- matplotlib
- IPython, Jupyter -> IPython helps you do the job iof iteration faster, as is typically done with data anaylstics work
-- IPython became Jupyter, so it includes more languages
- scikit-learn
- scipy -> collection of packages to address a lot of computational needs
-- You can optimize, do linear algebra, do stats 
- scikit-learnit -> machine learning toolkit
-- has a lot of different machine learning algorithms to try out
- Statsmodels
-- typical econometrics models are here.

Ipython
- using tab will show you the kind of methods you can use on an object, as well as modules
- object followed by '?' gives you information about the object. e.g. b?. same is for a function
- when you create your own function with """ """, the question mark will return this definition




Analysis types:
- sentiment analysis: processing words of news and social media to understand what people feel.
